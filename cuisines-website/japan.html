            <h2>Brief History of Japanese Cuisine</h2>
            <p>Like the nation itself, Japanese food has a rich and diverse past. It originated during the Jomon period (14,000–300 BCE), 
               when vegetables, fish, and rice made up the majority of the diet. Since Buddhism discourages eating meat, there has been 
               a noticeable movement towards vegetarian food since its arrival in the sixth century CE. Sushi and other now-iconic fish 
               dishes were created during the Edo period (1603–1867 CE), which revolutionized Japanese cuisine. Japanese cuisine has adopted 
               Western culinary influences in the modern era, adding new ingredients and cooking methods while maintaining its traditional 
               flavor. The Japanese diet is still characterized by this blending of the traditional and the modern.</p>

          <h2>Matcha</h2>
          <p>
            Finely ground dried tea leaves are used to make this Japanese green tea powder. The high quantities of chlorophyll 
            in the leaves give it a vivid green hue and a slightly bitter, vegetal taste. Although it has long been a staple of traditional 
            Japanese tea rituals, its health benefits have recently led to its popularity in the US.
            The samurai class of Japan embraced ceremonial tea drinking with great enthusiasm. The samurai were formidable fighters 
            but also cultured and important figures in Japanese social hierarchy. The essence of the samurai was shaped by Zen Buddhism, 
            incorporating values such as discipline, ceremony, and cleansing.

          <p>
            There will undoubtedly be shrines everywhere you go in Japan. Each one is devoted to a particular deity, 
            such as the sea or the god of war. The water deity is Watatsumi. Additionally, fishermen go to Watatsumi 
            shrines across the nation to donate fish as a way to seal the contract and pray for good fishing fate. It's a 
            meditation on the close ties that Japanese people have with delicacies like salmon, which bridge the gap between 
            the spiritual and material worlds.
